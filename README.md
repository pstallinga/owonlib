# owonlib
Library for Owon oscilloscopes USB Linux

Communicating through USB to Owon Oscilloscopes. Tested with two different SDS7102 models.

It needs the libusb-dev library installed on your system to have access to the usb library

I used CodeLite for writing and debugging. Make sure you add "-lusb" to your project Linker Options
